Simple game for Android that will allow you to compete with your crazy friends using numbers and all kind of operations.

### Features
Right now you can:
* Add a new game using your custom name.
* Have a single friend join your game and...
* Play, of course. Picking numbers from 1 to 9, you will be granted one of five operations, and then result will be appended to your number. Except for rolling `=` (equals). That you won't enjoy.

You can obviously set a name for yourself, to make it easier to distinguish you from other playing fellows.

### In progress
Of course, things above aren't it all. Right now we have in development:
* Convenient view of your games, as well as all available public games.
* Notifications, when your turn arrives or you've been invited for a game.
* Bluetooth mode, allowing you to play with your friends at one place without internet connection.
* Variety of modes, including limited tours, limited time, blitz/bullet mode, reverse choice, fighting with teams etc.
* Cards allowing players to change their fate, once.
* Some kind of simple and fast communication during the match and besides.
* Whatever more comes to the heads.

All those goods are planned to be delivered before project's hit on Google Play. Stay tuned, though!
